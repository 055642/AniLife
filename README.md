Organize your local anime library and track your progress with ease using AniLife
# ðŸ§¾Backstory
I watch anime alot, but since I have a slow internet speed I have to download anime, watch it and then delete it, after about 100+ anime I decided to not delete them and store them as a local collection instead, with the growing number of animes I ran into a problem of organize them and track my progress, I used and still using AniList but sometimes I don't have access to internet and AniList will not organize my local anime collection, I tried some offline alternatives but the design and the functionality I wanted wheren't available, so I made one!
